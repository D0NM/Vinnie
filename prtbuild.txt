Source codes for Super Pooh port.
Compilation with EDITOR or DEMO macros not tested.
Some files missing (like mouse) - you can still find them in original source code archive:

To compile for DOS16 (realtime mode) you'll need the following files:

MOD-OBJ.OBJ - from official home page (archive "modobj.zip"): https://awe.com/mark/dev/modobj.html
FAMEGRAF.OBJ - generated from "FAMEGRAF.ASM" with "asmbuild.bat"
JOYSTICK.OBJ - generated from "JOYSTICK.ASM" with "asmbuild.bat"
JOY.C - joystick code
JOY.H - joystick code
KEYS.C - keyboard code
KEYS.H - keyboard code
FAMELIB.CPP - library game code
FAMEMISC.CPP - misc game code
POOH.CPP - main game code
ALL.H - additional header files
FAMEGRAF.H - additional header files

You can use Borland Turbo C version at least 3.xx to compile source codes (make a project with all these files).
Please not that if you replace MOD-OBJ.OBJ with MODOBJ-R.OBJ from registered version of modplayer code for PC Speaker patch will not work!
Also note that you need to set a "Large" model to compile source codes.
Do not forget to post-process final file:
C:\TC3\BIN\TDSTRIP.EXE POOHD.EXE
C:\UTILS\LZEXE.EXE POOHD.EXE
TDSTRIP.EXE - is a Borland Turbo Debugger Symbols Stripper
LZEXE.EXE - is an executable file packer (version 0.91)



To compile for Win32 (Windows x86) you'll need the following files:
modmusic/modmusic.c - music player code for "IN_SK00L.DLL" (archive "oldsk00l_last_beta.zip"): https://www.rift.dk/projects/oldsk00l/
modmusic/modmusic.h - music player code
modmusic/in2.h - Winamp2 input plugin header file
modmusic/out.h - Winamp2 output plugin header file
JOY.H - joystick code
KEYS.H - keyboard code
FAMELIB.c - library game code
FAMEMISC.c - misc game code
POOH.c - main game code
ALL.H - additional header files
FAMEGRAF.H - additional header files
famegraf.c - C code substitute for FAMEGRAF.ASM assembler code for DOS
platform.c - Windows routines
platform.h - Windows routines

setpoohw.c - very simply standalone setup tool for Windows

Please not that you NEED TO replace *.CPP extension with *.c ("c" MUST BE LOWERCASED!) or you get a "__gxx_personality_v0" error in GCC!
I use to compile GCC 3.2 (mingw special 20020817-1) from DEV-CPP distributive.

Use "winbuild.bat" to build both files "poohw.exe" and "setpoohw.exe" for Windows.
